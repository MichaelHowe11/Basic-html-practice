        <strong><li>
            Dishonored
        </li></strong>
        <em><p>Dishonored is one of the best games I've ever played and I really like being a cool assassin.</p></em>
        <strong><li>
            Project Zomboid
        </li></strong>
        <em><p>One of the best zombie survival games I've ever played, very unforgiving and extremely hard.</p></em>
        <strong><li>
            Roblox
        </li></strong>
        <em><p>Very fun to play with friends, and also infinite replayability since gamemodes are made by the players everyday</p></em>
        <strong><li>
            Battlebit Remastered
        </li></strong>
        <em><p>It's like battlefield but better, battles can be as big as 127vs127 (or 254 players) on one single map.</p></em>
